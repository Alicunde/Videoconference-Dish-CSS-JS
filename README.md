# Videoconference-Dish | [DEMO](https://alicunde.github.io/Videoconference-Dish-CSS-JS/)
This script respects the Aspect Ratio, allows margins and does not use a grid. Lightweight and easy to understand.

I have searched the internet a lot and I have not found this script. It just keeps the aspect ratio of a div and covers the largest area of its parent.

Its use is mainly oriented to videoconferencing systems and not to make strange cuts.

It is built with few lines of code. It makes use of JavaScript and CSS. JavaScript is vanilla and surely you can optimize it.

The CSS is really basic, basically I have not wanted to fill this example with code and make it easy to copy and paste.

If you see any errors, I would appreciate if you would indicate the improvement or the bug.
